			<h2>Overview of OFDM technology</h2>
			<p>
				i) OFDM is a multiplexing technology which splits data stream into multiple narrow band streams and each of the smaller streams modulates a carrier.
				</p>
				<p>
				ii) The receiver receives all the multiplexed streams of data and demultiplexes them to form the final signal.
				</p>
				<p>
				iii) sidebands from each carriers overlap but they can be received without interference as they are orthogonal to each other.
				</p>
				<p>
				iv) Although it has the advantage of high spectral efficiency, it is complex, expensive and sensitive to carrier frequency variations.
